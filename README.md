## Minnesota Trail Finder

### Problem
- The state run sites for finding trails are difficult to use and missing many of the trails as well as detailed trail information.

### Solution
- A site that provides users a way to croud source information on trails
- Allows adminitratros to manage the trail data through an admin portal
- Users are able to flag trails of interest and save them on a list
- Users are also able to flag trails that should not be on the site
- Tags for the trails allow them to quickly be searched and filtered
